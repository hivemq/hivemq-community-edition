/**
 * Interface for the simple authentication of MQTT clients.
 * <p>
 * Simple authentication only uses CONNECT and CONNACK but no AUTH packets. This means:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it does not support challenge/response style authentication</li>
 *   <li>it does not support re-authentication</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An SimpleAuthenticator can be provided by an {@link com.hivemq.extension.sdk.api.services.auth.provider.AuthenticatorProvider AuthenticatorProvider}.
 * <p>
 * If an implementation stores state, an object of the implementation can not be shared by different clients.<br/>
 * If no state is stored, the implementation has to be thread safe if it is shared by different clients.
